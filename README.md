#### Update: October 20th 2023

After consultation from people more experiencced in the field, it was recommended to me that I pick up C with OS, and then move onto Rust. This will provide me better understanding of Rust, and what about it makes it so great. Consdering that this is the direction I wanted to take with this language, (Systems Programming), I am deciding to temporarily halt my Rust endeavor. 

Anyone can learn syntax and familiarize themselves with a language. Having the necessary concepts to use it properly is more significant.

Once I have 1 ~ 2 projects manipulating systems with C on this GitHub, I'll come back and continue to pick this language back up.
